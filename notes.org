Using [[#heuer1991]]'s approach a solution for a class of 2x2 finite games is obtained.
:abstract:
We consider two person zero-sum games with lack of information on one side given
by two 2×2-matrices A1 and A2 for which val [pA1 +(1−p)A2]=p valA1+(1−p) valA2.
Using the approach developed by Heuer [1991] we give the explicit solution for
all such finitely repeated games. It provides a supplement to the recent results
on the limiting behavior of the value for these games (see Mertens, Sorin and
Zamir [1990], De Meyer [1989], [1993]).

We are grateful to the referees and the editor in charge for helpful and
instructive comments and especially for the printed materials on the subject.

:abstract:
We consider two person zero-sum games with lack of information on one side given
by m matrices of dimension m×m. We suppose the matrices to have the following
“symmetric” structure: a_{ij}^s=a{ij}+c δ_i^s, c>0, where δ_i^s=1 if i=s and δ_i^s=0 otherwise.
Under certain additional assumptions we give the explicit solution for finite
repetitions of these games. These solutions are expressed in terms of
multinomial distributions. We give the probabilisitc arguments which explain the
obtained form of solutions. Applying the Central Limit Theorem we get the
description of limiting behavior of value closely connected with the recent
results of De Meyer [1989], [1993].

For a class of repeated two-person zero-sum games with incomplete information it
was proved by Aumann and Maschler that lim_{n→∞}v_n n ∞ v n exists, Ν n being the value
of the game with n repetitions. As for the speed of convergence Aumann and Maschler
showed that the error term δ n=¦Ν n−limΝ n¦ is bounded from above by c/√n for some
positive constant c. Both results have been generalized by Mertens and Zamir. It is
shown in this paper that the above mentioned theorem about the speed of
convergence is sharp in the sense that there are games in which δ n≥c′/√n for
some positive constant c′. However there are games for which δn is of a lower
order of magnitude, for instancec′(logn)/n≤δ n≤c (logn)/n orc′/n≤δ n≤c/n.
Sufficient conditions are given here for games to belong to one of these
categories as well as examples of games from each category.

A duality theorem on a pair of simultaneous functional equations
:abstract:
Given P and Q convex compact sets in RkandRs, respectively, and u a continuous
real valued function on P × Q, we consider the following pair of dual problems:
Problem I—Minimize ƒ so that ƒ: P × Q → R and ƒ ⩾ CavpVexq × max(u, ƒ). Problem
II—Maximize g so that g: P × Q → R and g ⩽ Vexq × Cavpmin(u, g). Here Cavp is
the operation of concavification of a function with respect to the variable p ϵ
P (for each fixed q ϵ Q). Similarly, Vexq is the operation of convexification
with respect to q ϵ Q. Maximum and minimum are taken here in the partial
ordering of pointwise comparison: ƒ ⩽ g means ƒ(p, q) ⩽ g(p, q) ∀(p, q) ϵ P × Q.
It is proved here that both problems have the same solution which is also the
unique simultaneous solution of the following pair of functional equations: (i)
ƒ = Vexqmax(u, ƒ). (ii) ƒ = Cavpmin(u, ƒ). The problem arises in game theory,
but the proof here is purely analytical and makes no use of game-theoretical
concepts.

On a pair of simultaneous functional equations
:abstract:
For each p in the simplex P of Rk we introduce convex subsets of P, ΠI(p) and
ΠII(p). For f a real function on P we define Cav1f to be the smallest function
greater than f on P and concave on Π1(p) for each p in P (and similarly VexIIf).
Given u a continuous real function on P we prove that the following problems:
Minimizef;f:→R, f⩽CavI VexII max{u,f}Minimizef;f:→R, f⩾VexII CavI min{u,f} have
the same solution which is also the only solution of f = Vex11 max{u,f} = Cav1
min{u,f}. This is an extension of a former proof by Mertens and Zamir for the
case where P is a. product of convex R and S with ΠI(p) = r × S and ΠII(p) = R ×

:abstract:
Characterization of all equilibria of nonzero-sum two-person repeated games with
incomplete information, in the standard one-sided information case. Informally,
each such equilibrium is described by a sequence of communications between the
players (consisting of information transmission and coordination), leading to
some individually rational agreement. Formally, the concept of a bi-martingale
is introduced.

The continuous-time version of Kyle's (1985) model of asset pricing with

in closed form for general distributions of the asset value. A particular
example is a lognormal distribution, for which the equilibrium price process is
a geometric Brownian motion. General trading strategies are allowed. In
equilibrium, the informed agent, who is risk neutral, has many optima, but he
does not correlate his trades locally with the noise trades nor does he submit

Price dynamics on a risk averse market with asymmetric information
:abstract:
A market with asymmetric information can be viewed as a repeated exchange game
between an informed sector and an uniformed sector. The case where all agents in
the market are risk neutral was analyzed in De Meyer [2010]. The main result of
that paper was that the price process in this risk neutral environment should be
a particular kind o Brownian martingale called CMMV. This type of dynamics is
due to the strategic use of their private information by the informed agents. In
this paper, we generalize this analysis to the case of a risk averse market. Our
main result is that the price process is still a CMMV under a martingale
equivalent measure
